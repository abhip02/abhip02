üî≠ **Interests:** Machine learning, compilers, parallel computing, and embedded systems.

üå± _**Recent Projects:**_

   **GPU Kernels: Metal Kernels for M1 GPU Mac**
   - Use Objective-C for host CPU to execute Compute Pipelines, and MSL (Metal Shading Langauge) for kernels
   - Ex: 1D Prefix Sum, 1D Dot Product, 2D Matrix Multiply
   
   **Compilers: ChocoPy to RISC-V Code Generation + Optimization**
   - Wrote an end-to-end compiler in Java: lexing, parser, type checking, semantic analysis, RISC-V assembly code generation
   - Implemented optimizations like constant folding, loop unrolling, function in-lining, common subexpression elimination, and copy propogation

   **ML: _PopDescent_**
   - Used Python‚Äôs TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, to build a global optimization algorithm to improve training performance on CNN, LSTM, and LLM benchmarks
   -  Achieved 12% lower test loss in 15% fewer gradient steps (on average) against Sklearn, Keras Tuner, and popular learning rate schedules
   - First author in ‚Äúcomputational algorithm development‚Äù paper submission to ICML 2024; [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14671]

   **Firmware: Audio DSP at Johnson&Johnson MedTech**
   - Configured STM32 mcu to manually perform DSP and translate raw microphone bitstreams into encoded ‚ÄúAES‚Äù protocol
   - Enabled circular buffering and manage interrupt race conditions for DMA memory transfer using callbacks and FreeRTOS
   -  Used Arm SIMD vectorization to optimize CPU memory by 15%, and decrease runtime by 8% to allow extra DSP functionality
